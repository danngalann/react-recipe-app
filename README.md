# React Recipe App
This app lets you search recipes by keywords. It was a good way for me to practice fetching and parsing data from an external API.
In case you want to use the code, you'll need to rename config_example.js to config.js and enter your API key from [edamam](https://developer.edamam.com).

## Demo
